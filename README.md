This file is the first commit to my repository and I am too excited. 
This is an accelerated task or a self-paced project where we need to develop insights from existing IT service desk tickets. The use case can be defined as creating a model for predicting resolution for a ticket created by user. The resolution will be based on historical tickets data upon which the machine learning (NLP) model has been built.
Started with topic modelling using Gensim (a powerful , scalable and commercial tool).
Algorithm : LDA, LDA_mallet
